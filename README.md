# FileUploadSystem
The Printshop App is a Java-based application designed to simplify the file upload and download process for print shops. Users can upload files directly to a shop's designated directory by scanning a QR code provided by the shop. This eliminates the need for traditional methods like email or WhatsApp for file transfers.
